## Who am I? ##
My name is Ryan Ram and I am a current Masters student of Baruch College with my focus in data analytics. I enjoy the world of data and seeing all of the capabilities that companies can attain through the usage of data. In my free time I enjoy working out and playing video games. Maybe once day I will end up working for a video game company as that would be a fun experience.
